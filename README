Pandora Sleep Timer For Mac

This is a quick bash script that works as a sleep timer for the Pandora desktop application.

The app asks how long you want the timer to run, then fades out the volume over the last
five minutes of the requested interval.

The script uses Applescript calls to handle the volume settings.

This script would work just as easily for any other music application, just edit it to 
kill the music app of your choice instead of Pandora.
